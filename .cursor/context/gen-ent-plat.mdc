üëë Product & Strategy
This covers the vision, market fit, and business model of the platform.

Vision & Roadmapping

Market Research: In-depth analysis of competitors (Webflow, Framer, Squarespace, and emerging AI builders) to define unique value propositions.

User Persona Expansion: Develop detailed personas beyond the "Creative Entrepreneur" to include small businesses, agencies, and event organizers.

Product Roadmap: Define feature releases post-MVP, including multi-page sites, e-commerce integration, blogging capabilities, and team collaboration.

Pricing & Monetization: Establish a tiered subscription model (e.g., Free, Pro, Business) based on features like custom domains, number of sites, analytics, and AI generation credits.

üé® UX & UI Design
This focuses on the entire user journey, from first contact to published website.

Core Conversational Experience

Guided Onboarding: An interactive tutorial that teaches users how to write effective prompts.

Prompt Assistance: AI-powered suggestions, auto-completion, and prompt templates (e.g., "Create a pricing table with 3 tiers").

Error & Refinement Flow: A user-friendly way to handle AI failures or to ask for modifications (e.g., "Make the text bigger," "Change the main color to blue").

Visual Tone & Brand Identity: Develop the logo, color palette, and typography for the Composer application itself.

The Composer Workspace

Interactive Canvas: Evolve the preview into a "Direct Manipulation" canvas where users can click text or images to trigger a modification prompt.

Style Editor: A panel for global style management (fonts, colors, spacing) that updates the AI's core "Style Prompt" context.

Component Management: Allow users to re-order, delete, regenerate, and save components as custom templates.

Responsive Mode: A toggle on the canvas to preview the site on tablet and mobile viewports.

User Dashboard

Project Management: A central hub to view, edit, and manage all created websites.

Account & Billing: A secure section for users to manage their subscription, payment methods, and view invoices.

Analytics: A simple dashboard displaying site traffic and engagement metrics for published sites.

üíª Frontend Development
This is the implementation of the user-facing application.

Application Shell & Workspace

Component Library: Build a robust library of internal UI components (buttons, modals, forms) using Chakra UI.

State Management: Implement a scalable Zustand store to manage authentication, project state, and real-time AI interactions.

Safe HTML Rendering: Use a sandboxed iframe with srcDoc to render the user-generated HTML, preventing style conflicts and security risks.

User & Project Management

Authentication: Full user authentication system (email/password, social logins) via Supabase Auth.

Dashboard Implementation: Build the UI for managing projects, domains, and account settings.

API Integration: Connect the frontend to the backend APIs for all data operations.

üß† Backend & AI Engineering
This is the core engine that powers the platform's intelligence and functionality.

The "Composer" AI Engine

Advanced Prompt Chaining (LangGraph): Create a multi-step AI workflow:

Intent Recognition: Classify the user's prompt (e.g., creating a new component vs. modifying an existing one).

Context Injection: Fetch the global style_prompt and relevant historical context.

Code Generation: Construct the final "meta-prompt" and send it to the Gemini API.

Code Validation & Sanitization: Check the generated HTML for validity and strip out any potentially malicious code.

Component Modification Logic: Develop a system where the AI can receive a component's existing HTML and a modification prompt (e.g., "change the button color") to produce updated code.

Image Generation/Selection: Integrate an AI image model to generate or suggest stock photos based on the user's prompts (e.g., "a hero with a picture of a serene beach").

Platform Backend

Database Architecture: Evolve the Supabase schema to include tables for users, subscriptions, custom_domains, and media_assets.

Secure REST/GraphQL API: Build a comprehensive API for all frontend-backend communication.

Website Publishing Service: A robust workflow triggered by the "Publish" button that compiles the site, and uses the Vercel API to manage deployments, domain mapping, and updates.

Billing Integration: Integrate with Stripe to handle subscriptions, payments, and webhooks.

‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure & DevOps
This ensures the platform is scalable, reliable, and secure.

Hosting & Scalability

Production Environment: Set up distinct development, staging, and production environments on Vercel and Supabase.

Rate Limiting & Cost Management: Implement checks to manage Gemini API usage and prevent abuse.

Database Scaling: Plan for database performance tuning and scaling as user data grows.

Asset Management: Use Supabase Storage or another CDN for user-uploaded images and media.

Operations & Security

CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment for both the frontend application and backend functions.

Monitoring & Alerting: Set up comprehensive logging and alerting to monitor application health, API errors, and AI generation failures.

Security Audits: Regularly perform security audits to protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) and ensure data privacy.

üöÄ Go-to-Market & Growth
This covers how you will attract, retain, and support your users.

Marketing & Branding

Launch Campaign: A coordinated launch on platforms like Product Hunt, Hacker News, and relevant design/tech communities.

Content Marketing: Create tutorials, blog posts, and video content showcasing what's possible with Composer.

Community Building: Establish a Discord or Slack community for users to share their creations, exchange prompts, and provide feedback.

Showcase Gallery: A curated gallery of the best websites built with Composer to inspire new users.

Customer Enablement

Help Center & Documentation: Comprehensive guides on prompting, features, and troubleshooting.

Customer Support System: A streamlined process for handling user inquiries, bug reports, and feature requests.

Legal & Compliance

Terms of Service & Privacy Policy: Draft clear policies regarding data usage, content ownership, and acceptable use.

Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
